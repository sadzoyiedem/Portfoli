          <p>
            I am a young individual born on May 18, 2006, to Mr. Francis Adzoyi and Mrs. Theresa Adzoyi. I hail from Alakple in the Volta Region of Ghana. 
            <br> 
            At the age of 3, I began my educational journey at Firm Foundation School, where I received my early education. From there, I moved on to Christ Preparatory School in Grade 1, before continuing my studies at Cedar Hills International School, where I completed my basic education.

In 2021, I graduated from Cedar Hills International School, where I was honored as the overall best student of my graduating class. 
<br> 
Shortly after, I enrolled at the University Practice Senior High School, a prestigious institution within the University of Cape Coast. I spent two and a half years there, receiving a solid secondary education.

<br>
In 2024, I successfully completed my secondary education and sat for the WASSCE exams. By God's grace, I achieved excellent results, which led to my admission into the renowned Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST). I am currently pursuing my tertiary education at KNUST, eager to further develop my knowledge and skills.
